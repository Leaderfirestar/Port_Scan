# Port_Scan
With the most recent update, my portscanner now uses swing to create a gui to allows easier use of its funcitonality. This project was inspired by a friend challenging me to create a basic port scanner. Several months ago, I had a very not-user-friendly command line interface set up to do the job. One of the things I had hoped to improve upon was to implement a GUI. Well, here it is! This project has given me an introduction to socket programming, and also shown me the basics of using swing. It's by no means a replace for a professional grade portscanner like nmap, but I'm still proud of what I've turned this into
